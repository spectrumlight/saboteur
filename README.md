# saboteur
Saboteur is a Python script designed for network testing and security research purposes, providing two functions: "deauth" and "jamming." This toolkit is intended for ethical use only, such as identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing network security. 

1. The deauth function serves as a tool to deauthenticate all users connected to a specific WiFi network. This feature simulates a deauthentication attack, helping network administrators and security professionals to test the resilience of their networks against unauthorized access.

2. The jamming function specializes in polluting WiFi traffic, creating disruptions to assess network robustness and identify potential weaknesses. Users can use tools like Wireshark to analyze the impact of the jamming attack on network communication.
